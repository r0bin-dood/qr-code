## About

This project started as an excuse to familiarize myself with image formats, especially JPEG. Since I wanted to re-invent the wheel by not using any existing image libraries, it also served as a challenging programming project. Understanding of this topic will help me in bigger, more ambitious projects; where not only do I plan on not using any existing code, but on creating my own image formats as well.
